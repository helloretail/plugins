# Hello Retail Knowledge

Answer Hello Retail questions **wiki-first** from the bundled copy at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/wiki/`. Do not invent facts about Hello Retail.

## Lookup procedure

1. Start at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/wiki/README.md` — its Quick Index maps every folder, and each folder's index page lists its pages. Every page opens with `source` (public-docs / field / index) and `verified` frontmatter; say so in the answer when a page is `verified: never`.
2. Follow the index to the right page, or grep across `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/wiki/` for specific terms (SKUs, field names, acronyms, error strings).
3. Read the full page before answering — pages cross-link; follow links when the first page defers to another.
4. **Always cite the wiki path** in the answer, e.g. `features/product-agents/product-agents.md`.

## High-signal entry points

| Question | Read first |
|---|---|
| What is Hello Retail? | `overview/what-helloretail-does.md` |
| What does feature X do? | `features/features.md` |
| How does the AI work? | `features/product-intelligence/product-intelligence.md` |
| How do we onboard a customer? | `onboarding/customer-onboarding-flow.md` |
| Acronym / jargon | `glossary/glossary.md` |
| Platform-specific install nuance | `platforms/platforms.md` |
| Reusable code snippets (feature × platform) | `cheat-sheets/` |
| Search base files (Liquid/CSS/JS) | `base-templates/base-templates.md` |

(All paths relative to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/wiki/`.)

## Rules

- **The live site wins.** If the wiki seems to disagree with helloretail.com or support.helloretail.com, say so and prefer the live site; flag the wiki page as possibly stale.
- **Don't fabricate people, customers, or partners.** If someone or something isn't documented in the wiki, say so.
- **Never include customer-identifiable data** (SKUs, prices, per-customer code) in answers destined for shared documents.
- If the wiki doesn't cover the question, say so plainly — and suggest the asker contribute the answer once found.
- To change content, open a pull request against `plugins/hello-retail/docs/wiki/` in `helloretail/plugins` — the wiki there is the source, not a copy.
