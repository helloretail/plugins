# QA checklist — Pages

HR-rendered category pages. For tile-level items use `product-tile.md`.

> **API-based Pages: this checklist does not apply.** Before walking any item, check the HR
> widget's Pages tab — a solution titled **"Pages (API)"** means the customer's own backend
> consumes the HR Category API and renders category pages with their own template (signature:
> `hr-search-product-code="pa-<pagesKey>|…"` on the customer's own markup in the raw HTML).
> The customer owns that UI and logic — record the feature as `SKIPPED — API-based`
> (qa-checklists SKILL.md Step 2), keep the feed/data + operator items, and stop here.
> What else D&TS should QA on API-based Pages is TBD with the QA team (2026-07-20).

> **No native reference:** Pages *replaces* the customer's category page. If toggling Pages
> off (widget Show switch) reveals a blank page / empty container, there is no native design
> to compare against — record the parity-vs-customer items as
> `N/A — Pages replaces the native page` and verify functionality only (see pages-qa
> SKILL.md → Step 3). Pricing is then verified against the PDP instead of a native tile.

## Placement / general

> On every page, first enable **ALL** solutions the HR widget lists (open it via
> `#addwishPageAdd`; Show toggles under `#addwish-panel-root`) — Pages plus any recoms/search
> present, not one at a time — wait for
> them to render, then QA normally. Record only what's still broken after enabling
> (see SKILL.md → Step 3, "enable before you judge").

- [ ] Not shown on all category pages (e.g. News)
- [ ] Feed removes hierarchies → Pages won't render on those categories (check the feed's
  hierarchy transformations via `feeds_get` when a website-uuid is provided; **skip this
  item if Pages was set up with categoryIDs** — those don't depend on feed hierarchies)
- [ ] Width of the pages window differs from page to page
- [ ] Their own "category page" is still active
- [ ] Analytics missing (if already live) *(spot-check via `pages_getAnalyticsOverview` — only LIVE pages produce analytics; drafts serve nothing)*

## Design

- [ ] Different pages design throughout the site
- [ ] Different tile views (grid/list)
- [ ] Category recom: set up but not shown — and if one exists, verify it works **both** on the
  customer's own category pages and inside HR Pages
- [ ] Navigation (e.g. shown in multiple places)
- [ ] Navigate to a new page → adds 'Clear all' text to the page…
- [ ] Navigate (and go back) → marks both the previous page and the current page as active
- [ ] Pagination looks like the shop's own pagination (or, when the shop has none, follows the
  theme's own `.pagination` / `.page-link` rules): active page in the shop's active colour, not
  HR's blue; prev/next arrows are styled like the number buttons and have the **same rendered
  height** (SVG-only buttons come out shorter unless the design fixes the height); the row is
  centred and fits a phone width. Fix: `pages-developer` step 4g.
- [ ] Numbered pagination with ellipsis (when the shop wants `1 2 3 … 20`): click page 1, next a few
  times, a middle page, the last page, prev twice — exactly one active page at every step, `…`
  only where pages are skipped, prev hidden on page 1 and next on the last page, no gaps
  around the `…`, one row at phone width. Fix: `pages-developer` step 4h.
- [ ] "Load more" button (when the shop wants a button instead of infinite scroll): nothing loads on
  scroll, each click appends exactly one page (also after a reload), the "shown of total" counter
  and the URL state follow, no duplicates, the block disappears on the last page, the button is
  styled like the shop's own button and centred under the grid. Fix: `pages-developer` step 4i.
- [ ] Navigate to a new page → can't open the filter
- [ ] Main menu: when opened, icons/wishlist button pop up on top of the menu window
- [ ] Mobile/tablet: not responsive / design breaks at those widths

### Styling

- [ ] Add/remove white space/padding (in between or above/below — it doesn't match the customer's design)
- [ ] Alignment
- [ ] Remove styling (de-clutter)
- [ ] Colors don't come from the customer's own palette — background, filter notifications,
  buttons etc. should reuse the shop's colors, not introduce new ones

## Filters — layout & behaviour

- [ ] Notification (color contrast, or not a circle)
- [ ] Notification: not shown properly (gets cut off)
- [ ] Labels pop up in filter dropdowns
- [ ] Tile is overwriting filter dropdowns
- [ ] Filter section takes up a lot of space (when placed on the left side of the window)
- [ ] Option text too long so it disappears / overwrites the amount-of-products
- [ ] Filter sidebar: styling is off and elements get cut off
- [ ] Filter sidebar: every time you choose an option it reloads the bar

## Filters — setup

- [ ] Missing (not showing the same filters as the customer does on their own category pages)
- [ ] Tablet: filter section is too small for the screen
- [ ] Tablet/mobile: filter button doesn't work
- [ ] Can't open the dropdown
- [ ] Options shown in the wrong language
- [ ] Checkboxes are missing / white space in front of options
- [ ] Checkbox overwrites the option text
- [ ] Mobile: when you scroll down, the filter dropboxes follow along
- [ ] Filter with only one option to choose from — should we add it as a sorting option instead?
- [ ] Shows filters without options (empty filters)
- [ ] Filter names: strange names…
- [ ] Reset button: not working
- [ ] Show options in alphabetical/numerical order
- [ ] Data in the filter list doesn't match the products
- [ ] Filter search engine: matches a letter anywhere in a word… not as the first letter
- [ ] Close button: doesn't work
- [ ] Close button: acting strange
- [ ] Can't read some characters ('ø')
- [ ] Selecting an option → reloads the filter window
- [ ] Price filter: when adding a price range it adds an 'x' in the corner
- [ ] Price filter: change the currency *(ACCEPTED exception: bare numbers with no currency
  symbol on the range slider are not a defect — the shared `ui_utility.register_filter`
  component has no currency parameter (QA team); flag only a **wrong** currency)*
- [ ] Price filter: highest price is shown in the middle instead of at the right end of the screen
- [ ] Price slider: strange price range shown
- [ ] BUG — price filter: when adding a range, it adds an x-button
- [ ] Mobile: price slider gets cut off
- [ ] Price filter: slider is not working / missing
- [ ] Too many options (random values, typos, multiple languages, and so on)
- [ ] Dropdown open → scroll down… the dropdown follows along
- [ ] Dropdown not shown…
- [ ] Gender filter: remove/add the correct products
- [ ] Brand filter: remove from the Brand page
- [ ] Selected filter options shown above the filter boxes instead of underneath…

### Category filter

- [ ] Don't show the category you are currently on (or higher levels) as a filter option —
  you should never be able to filter on main categories from within that same category
- [ ] Last category level (no sub-categories left) → don't show the category filter at all
- [ ] Can we remove 'all products' / 'brands' and add them as separate filters?
- [ ] Remove the white space in front of the category options
- [ ] Category names are too long and "disappear" (and overwrite the amount-of-products in the category)

### Sorting

- [ ] Not working
- [ ] RANDOM: shows multiple prices for a second
- [ ] Set up incorrectly
- [ ] Translation/typo issue
- [ ] Dropdown: looks a bit strange
- [ ] Options disappear because of the placement of the box
- [ ] Do we match the customer's own sorting options?
- **Not a defect — sort options not in alphabetical order.** Sort options follow the configured
  order (default sort first, then price / newest / …), never A→Z; compare the option set and
  the labels against the customer's own dropdown instead.
- [ ] Sorting on a number-like field (price, percentage, date, rating) actually orders
  numerically — verify the field's data type in the feed (`productData_get` on 2–3 SKUs, read
  the raw value, not just the schema): a string-typed field sorts lexicographically
  ("100" before "20", "9%" after "10%") and looks fine in the UI until sorted

## Loading

- [ ] Doesn't load in more products
- [ ] Products don't load in when navigating between category pages / on scroll — check every
  page type, not just the first one visited
- [ ] Script/panel loads slowly on the page
- [ ] Clicking on a product causes a delay
- [ ] **Oversized tile images across the grid** — a full-size feed original in a small tile slot,
      multiplied by 24–60 tiles per page view. Measure with the image-weight probe
      (`../SKILL.md` → Step 3); ≤2× PASS, >2–4× WARN, >4× FAIL. The most common real cause of
      "category pages got slower since Pages went live"

## Products

- [ ] Total amount of products differs from the customer's own pages
- [ ] Not shown on some category pages (finds 0 products…)
- [ ] Make sure the tiles have the same height
- [ ] When 0 products… starts to act strange
- [ ] When 0 products shown… all selected filters are no longer shown
- [ ] When 0 products… only shows navigation arrows

## Translations

- [ ] Solution is set up in the wrong language
- [ ] Typo, add a space, lower/upper case letter
- [ ] Translate the tile to the correct language
- [ ] Translations within the template (e.g. 'clear all')
- [ ] Translate filters to the correct language

## Dashboard

> **OPERATOR** — dashboard setting; the rendered behaviour (do OOS products appear on a page?)
> can support the finding, but the setting/decision needs the operator.

- [ ] Should we show out-of-stock products in Pages? Expected default: **ON**
