# Filter sorting — alphabetic ordering of the OPTIONS inside a filter

> **Before anything else: the filter chrome is base-owned, and half of it is invisible in the template.** See *Where the filter markup lives* at the bottom of this file. Never delete or rewrite filter CSS in `resultStyles` — an option list you can't see in `search.liquid` is still styled by rules you can see in `search.css`. → `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/wiki/base-templates/foundation-rules.md`

Optional. These are **filter-facet selectors**, separate from the trigger / placement selectors in `references/selectors.md`: they don't change where search lives, they change the **order of options inside a filter** (e.g. sort brands or hierarchies A→Z, sort sizes sensibly). Only wire them if the operator asks for it.

**Two different things get called "filter sorting" — be precise about which one you are fixing:**

| What is meant | Example | Where it is fixed |
|---|---|---|
| Order of the **filter groups** in the bar | Kategorier → Merke → Pris → Hudtype | Dashboard search-data config — `search_updateFilters` (the order of the `filters` array). Not this file. |
| Order of the **options inside one filter** | the brand list reads Abib, Anua, Beauty of Joseon … instead of feed order | `sorting_selectors` in `initializationCode` — **this file** |
| Order of the **sort options** (the sorting dropdown / mobile Sort list) | Relevans → Pris lav-høj → Pris høj-lav → Nyheder | Dashboard — `search_updateSorting`, the order of the `options` array. **Never alphabetised**: default sort first, then the rest as the customer's own dropdown lists them. Not this file, and not a QA finding. |

A QA card that says "filters not alphabetical" or "filter sorting" almost always means the **second** one (nobody notices seven group headings being out of order; everybody notices a 40-item brand list in random order). Fixing the group order does not sort a single option, and a report that says "filter ordering fixed" without naming which one is ambiguous — always say both, with their state.

## What's already in the base `search.js`

Every variant's `search.js` ships the sort machinery and two config variables, both defaulting to **disabled** (`""`):

```js
// sorting_selectors examples: .aw-filter__single-wrapper[data-filter="brand"], .aw-filter__single-wrapper[data-filter="hierarchies"]
/* text */ var sorting_selectors = "";
// size_selector examples: .aw-filter__single-wrapper[data-filter="sizes"]
/* text */ var size_selector = "";
```

The functions `sortFilters()` / `sortFilter()` / `sortSizes()` are already defined and called during render — you don't add logic, you only populate the two selector strings. `sortFilter()` handles both tag-list and tree-list (hierarchy) filters recursively.

> **The trap this creates — mechanism present ≠ sorting active.** Because the functions ship in every base `search.js`, every config *looks* like it sorts filter options when you read the code. It doesn't: `sortFilters()` iterates `document.querySelectorAll(sorting_selectors)`, and with the default `""` that is an empty list, so nothing is ever sorted. When you (or a QA pass) need to know whether options are alphabetized, **read the value of `sorting_selectors`** — never conclude from the presence of `sortFilter()`. A real code pass recorded "options already alphabetized client-side by `sortFilters()`" on a config whose `sorting_selectors` was `""` (store-NO-1 2026-09-01); the defect only surfaced when the operator pointed at the variable.

- **`sorting_selectors`** — comma-separated CSS list of the filters whose **options** get sorted **alphabetically**. List **every** LIST filter the operator confirmed should be A→Z (brand, skin type, ingredients, awards, …) — ask which, don't assume all; but once the list is agreed, a half-populated string is a half-fixed bug. Leave out Category (`hierarchies` — follows the category tree) and Size (use `size_selector`). Every clause must be a complete, quoted attribute selector — `.aw-filter__single-wrapper[data-filter="extraDataList.ingredients"]`; a malformed clause such as `[extraDataList.ingredients]` makes `querySelectorAll` throw a `SyntaxError` and silently disables sorting for **all** the listed filters, not just the broken one.
- **`size_selector`** — the filter whose options are sizes, sorted by a **size-aware** order (`sortSizes()`) rather than plain alphabetical, so `S, M, L, XL` don't come out as `L, M, S, XL`.

## Selector form depends on the variant

The wrapper class differs between desktop and mobile:

| Variant(s) | Filter wrapper class |
|---|---|
| `desktop-overlay`, `desktop-embedded` | `.aw-filter__single-wrapper` |
| `mobile-overlay` | `.hr-search-overlay-filter-wrap` |

Target a specific filter with its `[data-filter="…"]` attribute.

**Desktop** (`desktop-overlay` / `desktop-embedded`):

```js
/* text */ var sorting_selectors = '.aw-filter__single-wrapper[data-filter="brand"], .aw-filter__single-wrapper[data-filter="hierarchies"]';
/* text */ var size_selector = '.aw-filter__single-wrapper[data-filter="sizes"]';
```

**Mobile** (`mobile-overlay`):

```js
/* text */ var sorting_selectors = '.hr-search-overlay-filter-wrap[data-filter="brand"], .hr-search-overlay-filter-wrap[data-filter="hierarchies"]';
/* text */ var size_selector = '.hr-search-overlay-filter-wrap[data-filter="sizes"]';
```

## How to wire it

1. Ask the operator with `AskUserQuestion`, two questions in one call. Header `A→Z`: *"Do you want the options inside any filters sorted alphabetically (e.g. brand, skin type)?"* — `multiSelect`, *None — keep feed order* first, then the config's LIST filters from `search_getFilters` (Category and Size left out; more than three → the rest in a second question of the same call, header `A→Z more`), none recommended. Header `Size`: *"Should sizes be sorted size-aware?"* — *None — no size filter* first, then the filters that could be the size filter, a size-named one first "(Recommended)". If the request arrived as a QA finding or card item ("filters not alphabetical", "filter sorting"), it tells you **which kind** of sorting is meant (options, not groups — confirm you are not being asked about the filter-*group* order, which is Step 13b / `search_updateFilters`), but **not which filters**: list the config's LIST filters (`search_getFilters`) and ask the operator which ones to sort — the same `A→Z` picker — never assume all of them (real case, store-NO-1 2026-09-01: six LIST filters, the operator wanted three).
2. If **no** → leave both at `""`. Nothing else to do.
3. If **yes** → set `sorting_selectors` to the target filters using the variant's wrapper class, adding/removing filter names as needed (e.g. `extraData.color`). Set `size_selector` to the size filter if sizes need size-aware ordering.
4. Keep the leading `/* text */` annotation — it's an HR dashboard input marker; only the string literal changes.
5. Apply per variant using that variant's wrapper class (desktop vs mobile form).
6. **Copied from a sibling ("Same as …" on the `Sibling` picker) → copy, then check against the rules above.** The sibling's value can break them: a bare wrapper class with no `[data-filter]` (`'.aw-filter__single-wrapper'`) sorts **every** filter A→Z — Category included, which breaks the parent › child order, and number filters (year, gear count, wheel size) as text, so "10" lands before "7". Copy it verbatim as the operator chose, then name the conflict in one line — *"the sibling sorts all filters A→Z, including Kategori and the number filters"* — and ask whether to narrow it (`AskUserQuestion`, header `A→Z`: *Keep the sibling's setting* / *Narrow to the text filters*, neither recommended). Field case, store-DK-2 2026-10: copied unflagged, caught only in review.

## Where the filter markup lives — and why its CSS gets destroyed

The filter bar is **base chrome**, split across two sources. Understanding the split is what stops you from "cleaning up" its CSS:

**1. The wrapper — visible in `search.liquid`.** The `{% capture captured_filters %}` block (desktop-overlay / desktop-embedded) builds the bar itself:

```liquid
<div class="hr-filters">
  <ul class="aw-full-search-results__filter-wrapper">
    <li class="aw-filter__single-wrapper aw-filter__{{ key }}-wrapper" data-filter="{{ key }}">
      <button class="aw-filter__heading">{{ title }}
        <span class="hr-selected-filter-count">…</span></button>
      <div class="aw-filter-dropdown-content" style="display:none">{{ filter[1] }}</div>   ← platform-rendered
    </li>
    … plus the sorting <li> (data-filter="sorting", body = {{ sorting.asTagList }})
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="hr-filters-selected">   ← selected-filter tags + #hr-filter-selected-tag-reset </div>
```

`mobile-overlay` uses its own wrappers — `.hr-search-overlay-filter` / `.hr-search-overlay-filter-content` / `.hr-search-overlay-filters` / `.hr-overlay-search-filter-values`.

**2. The option list — NOT in the template.** `{{ filter[1] }}` and `{{ sorting.asTagList }}` are rendered by the Hello Retail platform, so the checkbox lists, hierarchy trees and the price range slider **never appear as markup you can read**. Their classes only exist in `search.css`. This is exactly why a stylesheet rewrite kills filter styling: nothing in the Liquid you're editing hints that these elements exist.

**The base-owned filter/sorting selectors — all of them read-only** (each has an `aw-` twin: `.aw-filter-list`, `.aw-range-slider`, …):

| Area | Selectors |
|---|---|
| Bar + wrappers | `.hr-filters`, `.aw-full-search-results__filter-wrapper`, `.aw-filter__single-wrapper`, `.aw-filter__heading`, `.aw-filter-dropdown-content`, `.hr-clear-filters` |
| Option lists (platform-rendered) | `.hr-filter-list`, `.hr-filter-tag-list`, `.hr-filter-tag-count`, `.hr-sorting-tag-list` |
| Range filter (platform-rendered) | `.hr-range-slider`, `.hr-range-slider-handle`, `.hr-range-slider-text{,-from,-to}`, `.hr-range-slider-clear` |
| Selected state | `.hr-selected-filter-count`, `.hr-sorting-seletected` *(base typo — keep it)*, `.hr-filters-selected`, `.hr-filter-selected-tag`, `.hr-filter-selected-tag-clear`, `.hr-filter-selected-tag-reset-btn` |
| Mobile | `.hr-search-overlay-filter`, `.hr-search-overlay-filter-content`, `.hr-overlay-search-filters`, `.hr-overlay-search-filter-values` |

**Consequences for a build:**

- **Never delete or rewrite these rules.** If a customer wants a different filter look, append an override with higher specificity — and if it can't be reached additively, ask the operator first.
- **Configure filters before you QA the design.** With no filters configured (or none returned for the query), `captured_filters` renders nothing, so a broken filter bar looks identical to a working one. Set the default filters (Step 13b) first, then run a real query, open a dropdown, select a value, drag the price slider, and switch sorting.
- **The overlay reset-block removal touches this too** — the reset was also normalizing HR's own `<ul>`/`<p>` chrome, so re-check the filter bar after removing it (`references/shell-structure.md`).

## Self-check

- [ ] Base filter/sorting CSS untouched — no rule from the table above deleted, reformatted, or rewritten; any filter restyling is an appended higher-specificity override (or was approved by the operator).
- [ ] Filters configured, then the filter bar verified rendered: dropdown opens, option list styled, selected-count badge, selected-tags row + clear-all, range slider, sorting.
- [ ] `sorting_selectors` set to the requested filters in the **variant-correct** wrapper form (desktop `.aw-filter__single-wrapper` / mobile `.hr-search-overlay-filter-wrap`), or left `""` if not requested.
- [ ] When option sorting was requested, the operator was asked **which** LIST filters (the `A→Z` picker, its options from `search_getFilters`) — not assumed to be all of them — and `sorting_selectors` lists exactly the agreed set; Category and Size are the standard omissions.
- [ ] Every clause is a complete quoted `[data-filter="…"]` selector — paste the string into `document.querySelectorAll(...)` in the console once; a `SyntaxError` means nothing is sorted.
- [ ] Done on **both** configs (desktop and mobile are separate designs — one is routinely left at `""`).
- [ ] Verified rendered, not inferred from code: open two or three of the listed filters on a real query and read the first options — they must be A→Z. The presence of `sortFilter()` in the JS proves nothing.
- [ ] `size_selector` set only when sizes need size-aware ordering; left `""` otherwise.
- [ ] `/* text */` annotations preserved; only the string literals changed.
