# Implementation Methods

Hello Retail offers two implementation methods. The choice usually drives 50% of the onboarding effort, so pick deliberately at kickoff.

## Method 1 — Script-based (recommended default)

> "Quick to implement, minimal coding, best for standard integrations with managed templates." — Platform overview page

### What it looks like

- Customer adds the Hello Retail JS to their shop.
- For most platforms, an extension/plugin/app does the install.
- Configurations live in [my.helloretail.com](https://my.helloretail.com/), not in customer code.
- Hello Retail manages the rendering templates server-side.

### When to choose

- Customer is on Shopify, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, DanDomain, SmartWeb, ScanNet, Shoporama, Wannafind, Starweb, Lightspeed, Shopware, Norce, Centra, etc. — basically any platform with a dedicated install guide.
- Customer has limited dev resources.
- Customer wants the fastest time-to-value.
- Customer doesn't need very custom front-end behavior.

### Where it lives in the KB

- [Manual Setup category](https://support.helloretail.com/general-setup/manual-setup/) — when no platform extension exists.
- [Installing the JavaScript](https://support.helloretail.com/general-setup/installing-the-javascript/) — generic.
- Per-platform install guides in [Setup of Platforms](https://support.helloretail.com/platforms-and-newsletter-providers/setup-of-platforms-category/).

## Method 2 — API

> "Offers maximum flexibility and control, suitable for custom solutions and complex requirements." — Platform overview page

### What it looks like

- Customer's developers consume Hello Retail's REST + GraphQL APIs directly.
- HR JS may still be used for tracking, but rendering is the customer's responsibility.
- Pages can be returned as HTML or JSON.
- Product Intelligence is available via a single GraphQL endpoint.

### When to choose

- Headless commerce setup (Next.js, Hydrogen, Nuxt, custom frontend).
- Customer needs unusual layouts not covered by managed templates.
- Customer wants to embed HR data in non-storefront systems (PIM, CDP, ESP, BI).
- Customer has strong frontend engineering and wants ownership.

### Where it lives in the KB / dev docs

- [Hello Retail API](https://support.helloretail.com/general-setup/hello-retail-api/)
- [Setup a custom integration](https://support.helloretail.com/general-setup/setup-a-custom-integration/)
- [developer.helloretail.com](https://developer.helloretail.com/) — full API reference + guides.
- [docs.helloretail.com](https://docs.helloretail.com/) — Product Intelligence GraphQL docs.

## Hybrid (common in practice)

Many customers end up **hybrid**:

- Script-based for Search and Recommendations on the storefront.
- API-based for Pages on a headless category page.
- API-based for Product Intelligence inside their CDP.

This is fine — start with the script and add API integration where needed.

## Decision matrix

| Question | Script-based | API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer's platform has a dedicated extension? | ✅ Yes — go script. | If absent, consider API. |
| Is the storefront headless? | Probably no. | Probably yes. |
| Customer wants to use HR data in non-storefront systems? | Limited. | ✅ Yes. |
| Dev team capacity? | Low capacity OK. | Needs real dev capacity. |
| Time-to-value matters most? | ✅ Yes. | Slower. |
| Need full control over UI? | Managed templates. | ✅ Full control. |

## D&TS notes

- **Always start the conversation with Script-based** and only move to API if the customer's setup or requirements force it.
- For **API customers**, set expectations on dev hours up-front — these projects can stretch 2–3× longer than script installs.
- For **Magento 2** specifically, the extension handles feeds, tracking, and the empty search page automatically — it's the fastest install in the suite.
