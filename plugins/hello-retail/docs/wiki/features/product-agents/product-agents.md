# Product Agents

## What it is

Agentic 1:1 email marketing. AI agents that **autonomously decide what emails to send, when, and to whom** — choosing the right products and send time for each individual customer in real time. Runs inside the customer's **Klaviyo** setup; no Klaviyo migration required.

## How it's different from traditional email automation

Traditional automation:

- Fixed rules and segments
- You define trigger, timing, content
- Sends every email that qualifies

Product Agents:

- Continuously evaluate the **entire customer base × entire catalog**
- Agent decides if a message is **worth sending**
- May delay or skip messages if not relevant
- One Product Agent email per recipient per day (hard cap); custom frequency caps available

## The six agents

Six agents run around the clock. Each addresses a specific revenue moment.

| Agent | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Price Drop – Viewed Product** | Alerts users when something they viewed drops in price. |
| **Price Drop – Alternative Product** | Surfaces on-sale alternatives the shopper hadn't considered. |
| **Price Drop – Purchased Replenishment** | Prompts re-orders of refill products when they go on sale. |
| **Replenishment Reminder** | Sends reminders based on **real product usage cycles**, not averages. |
| **Recommended Addons** | Cross-sells complementary products tailored to past purchases. |
| **Alternative Picks** | Follows up with relevant alternatives at the right moment. |

## How the Klaviyo integration works

- Connects to Klaviyo via API.
- When an agent sends, it triggers a Klaviyo flow.
- Agent passes generated content — subject line, headline, body, product picks — as **event properties** that populate the customer's Klaviyo template.
- Customer continues to use their existing Klaviyo templates.
- Performance is tracked in Klaviyo (opens, clicks, revenue).

Advanced use cases are exposed via webhooks.

See also [integrations/klaviyo.md](../../integrations/klaviyo.md) for the three layers at which Hello Retail connects to Klaviyo.

## Tone of voice

Customers can pick a preset tone or create their own. Agents adhere to it in subject + body generation.

## Dashboard

Shows scheduled, sent, and skipped messages. Preview tab lets you inspect any sent email's content.

## Pricing model

Credit-based: one credit is one message handed off to the email channel; skipped and test messages are free, and an auto-overage option keeps agents running when credits run out. Current prices, tiers and overage terms are on the [pricing page](https://helloretail.com/en/pricing/) — quote from there, not from here.

## Setup time

> "Most stores are up and running within a few hours — connect your Klaviyo account, configure a flow and template, and enable the agents you want. No complex flow-building required." — marketing FAQ

## D&TS notes

- **Product Agents requires Klaviyo.** Don't pitch to customers on other ESPs. (Yet — webhook-based custom integrations may be possible.)
- Expect questions on stability, rate limits and frequency-cap behaviour; start with the FAQ on the product page.
- Onboarding flow is simpler than a normal Hello Retail launch — most plumbing is via Klaviyo's API. Plan a few hours, not weeks.
- **Read the Available Agents article** before customer kickoff so you can recommend which agents to enable first based on the customer's catalog and behavior data.
