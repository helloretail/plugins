## How the modules relate

```
                  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
                  │        Product Intelligence (AI)        │
                  │  vectors • cross-shop relations • PI    │
                  └────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                                       │
   ┌───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                   │                                   │
   ▼                                   ▼                                   ▼
ONSITE                            EMAIL                                MARKETING
- Search                          - Newsletter Content                 - Audience
- Recommendations                 - Triggered Emails                   - Insights
- Pages                           - Product Agents
- Retail Media   ───────────────────┘ (RM also lives in emails)
```

The shared engine is **Product Intelligence** — that's why customers see consistent personalization across web and email even if they enable modules one at a time.

## Bundling notes (for D&TS)

- **Search + Recommendations** is the most common entry bundle.
- **Pages** is usually layered next, especially for catalogs >500 SKUs.
- **Newsletter Content + Triggered Emails** are the email entry points; **Product Agents** is the new premium email layer that requires Klaviyo.
- **Retail Media** is a monetization upsell — generally pitched once the store has **500k+ monthly views** so suppliers see worthwhile inventory.
- **Audience and Insights** are **free** with any paid plan — always turn them on during onboarding.
