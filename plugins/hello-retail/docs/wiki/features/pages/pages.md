# Pages

## What it is

Dynamic, personalized category and brand pages. Replaces the static, manually-sorted category page with one that adapts per-visitor based on behavior, affinity and predicted intent, while giving merchandisers explicit override controls.

## Why customers buy it

The pitch (paraphrased from a customer quote on the marketing site): a 300-category, 6,000-SKU store used to **manually** sort the position of each product in each category — an impossible operation. Pages takes that over while still giving merchandisers control.

## Capabilities

- Per-visitor personalization driven by Product Intelligence + behavior.
- Boostings (push categories of products up).
- Fixed products (pin specific products at specific positions).
- Pages Analytics — see what categories/brands perform vs. need a boost.
- Retail Media slots inside category pages.

## Integration modes

Pages can be integrated in three ways. The right choice depends on the customer's stack and SEO needs:

1. **Client-side** — Hello Retail JS renders the products into the existing category page. Fastest to ship.
2. **API integration (HTML response)** — Hello Retail returns rendered HTML the customer's backend can drop in. Good for server-rendered shops.
3. **API integration (JSON response)** — Customer's frontend consumes JSON and renders. Maximum control, common for headless stacks.

There are also platform-specific guides for **Shopify** and **DanDomain Classic** Pages setup.

## SEO considerations

Pages has a dedicated article ("Pages & Search Engine Optimization") on how to keep Google-indexable content intact when Pages replaces the default listing. This is a frequent customer question — review it before any Pages launch on an SEO-sensitive store.

## Design customizations

Pages output is themable to match the shop. See "Pages Design Customizations".

## D&TS notes

- For SEO-sensitive customers, **default to API integration (HTML response)** so crawlers see real markup, not JS-rendered placeholders.
- Always run **Pages Analytics** during the EBR — it surfaces under-performing categories that the customer's merchandising team should boost.
- For Shopify, follow the dedicated Pages-for-Shopify guide; the integration uses Shopify-specific routing patterns.
