## Custom / third-party platforms (with D&TS notes)

| Platform | Notes | D&TS guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Viskan / Streamline** | Nordic enterprise SPA. HR overlay is outside the CMS app root — CMS components need custom wiring. ATC goes through the `window.viskan.cart` API. Wishlist / favourite buttons are **not supported** — tiles ship without the star. | [viskan-streamline](./viskan-streamline/README.md) · [add-to-cart](./viskan-streamline/add-to-cart.md) · [feeds](./viskan-streamline/feeds.md) |

### Other custom platforms

For platforms not on the list:

- **General Guide:** [General Guide for Hello Retail Integration with Third-Party Platforms](https://support.helloretail.com/platforms-and-newsletter-providers/general-guide-for-hello-retail-integration-with-third-party-platforms/)
- **Custom integration:** [Setup a custom integration](https://support.helloretail.com/general-setup/setup-a-custom-integration/)
- **Developer docs:** [developer.helloretail.com](https://developer.helloretail.com/)

## Cross-cutting platform setup articles

- [Configure Webshop](https://support.helloretail.com/platforms-and-newsletter-providers/configure-webshop/) — core webshop configuration steps that apply across platforms.
- [Swiipe Plus-sell and Hello Retail](https://support.helloretail.com/general-setup/swiipe-plus-sell-and-hello-retail/) — note when running Swiipe alongside HR.

## Choosing between Script-based vs API

- **Script-based** suits Shopify, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, DanDomain, SmartWeb, ScanNet, Lightspeed and most SMB platforms.
- **API** suits Magento 2 (with the extension), Centra, Norce, Salesforce, headless setups, and any platform without a packaged integration.

## D&TS notes

- **Nordic-heavy customer base.** Most DK/SE platforms (SmartWeb, DanDomain, ScanNet, Shoporama, Starweb, Abicart, etc.) are well-supported. New CSMs joining from outside the Nordic ecommerce world should spend extra time reading those install guides.
- **Magento 2 extension** is the most "batteries-included" install — it sets up product feed, conversion data, and empty page automatically. Worth recommending to any Magento 2 customer who isn't headless.
- For Shopify, watch out for **old script remnants** from prior trials or competitors — see [Remove old Shopify scripts](https://support.helloretail.com/platforms-and-newsletter-providers/remove-old-shopify-scripts/) before launching.
