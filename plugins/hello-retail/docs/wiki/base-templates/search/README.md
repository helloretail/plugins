# Search — Base Templates

D&TS-canonical starting templates for the three Search overlay variants D&TS commonly works with.

## Variants

| Variant | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [desktop-overlay/](./desktop-overlay/) | Desktop full-screen overlay. Triggered by clicking any `input[type='search']`. Auto-deactivates below 992 px viewport width. | ✅ Captured |
| [desktop-embedded/](./desktop-embedded/) | Embedded inline variant that renders inside a page container, not full-screen. | ✅ Captured |
| [mobile-overlay/](./mobile-overlay/) | Mobile-only overlay with tabbed categories/products. | ✅ Captured |

Each variant lives in its own folder with `search.js`, `search.liquid`, `search.css`, and (when documented) a `README.md` covering config inputs and customization notes.

> For Instant/List and Grid/Full Search layouts, those ship upstream from the Hello Retail platform; D&TS rarely curates a starting version separately.

## Choosing a variant

- **Desktop full-screen** → start with [desktop-overlay/](./desktop-overlay/). This is the default.
- **Inline (no takeover)** → use [desktop-embedded/](./desktop-embedded/) when the customer wants results to appear in the page flow rather than over it.
- **Mobile** → always pair the desktop variant with [mobile-overlay/](./mobile-overlay/). HR's desktop overlay JS bails below 992 px (`return;` near the top of the file), so mobile *requires* its own template.

> ⚠️ **Extend, never rewrite.** The base `search.css` is ~1,300 lines and most of it styles chrome you don't see while building — filters, filter dropdowns, selected-filter counts, the price range slider, sorting, the results header, the content column, animations. A reworked stylesheet passes a first screenshot with the filter styling already destroyed. Override with higher specificity, and ask the operator before altering the foundation: [foundation-rules.md](../foundation-rules.md).

> ⚠️ **Before you ship:** an empty `CUSTOM_STYLING_BLOCK` is a *starting point*, not the finish. Keeping the customer's tile classes does **not** guarantee their theme CSS styles the tile inside the HR overlay — the theme often styles via a grid-ancestor the overlay doesn't reproduce, and HR's base `search.css` overrides the rest. Open the overlay, run a real search, and add a scoped parity block if needed. Method + checklist: [cheat-sheets/search/general.md → _Tile CSS parity_](../../cheat-sheets/search/general.md).
