# Hello Retail — Knowledge Base

> **Audience:** anyone implementing, configuring or supporting Hello Retail — Hello Retail's own delivery team, agencies, and customers' developers who need a single source of truth for what Hello Retail does, how it works, and how a customer is onboarded.

This is the Hello Retail knowledge base bundled with the `hello-retail` plugin. It started from a comprehensive crawl of [helloretail.com](https://helloretail.com/) and [support.helloretail.com](https://support.helloretail.com/) and is intended to evolve as we add onboarding code and internal playbooks.

## TL;DR — What is Hello Retail?

Hello Retail is an **ecommerce personalization platform** founded in 2013, headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark. The platform helps ecommerce teams "run better stores" using a proprietary AI layer called **Product Intelligence** that turns products into vectors and learns relationships across millions of products and orders.

Hello Retail's product surface has nine customer-facing modules:

1. **Search** — AI-powered, personalized site search
2. **Product Recommendations** — cross-sell / upsell across the journey
3. **Pages** — dynamic category & brand pages
4. **Newsletter Content** — personalized product blocks inside newsletters
5. **Triggered Emails** — abandoned cart, price drop, back in stock, post-conversion
6. **Retail Media** — sponsored products + banners (monetize traffic)
7. **Product Agents** *(new)* — agentic 1:1 email layered on top of Klaviyo
8. **Audience** — segmentation and Facebook custom audiences (free tier)
9. **Insights** — analytics & trends (free tier)

All of these sit on top of the **Product Intelligence** AI engine and the Hello Retail JavaScript that customers install on their webshop.

## D&TS at a Glance

D&TS (Delivery & Technical Services) is the umbrella for the three customer-facing post-sales teams:

- **Success** — drive long-term value, EBRs, optimization (Lasse Ingemann Lind, Anthony Derda Rizzuto, Stephanie Liekola Isla, Yaser Osman, and others).
- **Support** — fast technical answers and bug triage.

Head of D&TS: **Brian Petersen**.

For where each team plugs in during the customer lifecycle see [onboarding/onboarding.md](./onboarding/onboarding.md).

## Contributing to this wiki

Every page opens with a frontmatter block that says where its content came from and when someone last checked the whole page against that source:

```yaml
---
source: field          # public-docs | field | index
verified: 2026-09-14   # YYYY-MM-DD, or never — index pages omit it
---
```

| `source` | Means | Verify against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public-docs` | Paraphrased from helloretail.com, support.helloretail.com or developer.helloretail.com. | Those sites. |
| `field` | Written by D&TS from real onboardings. | The base templates, or a live store. |
| `index` | Navigation only. | Nothing — the lint checks its links. |

Set `verified` to today's date only after checking the **whole page**, not after editing a line.

`npm run lint:wiki` (part of `npm run check`, and run by CI) fails on a missing or malformed block, broken links, orphan pages, and anything customer-identifiable: website UUIDs, e-mail addresses, shop domains outside the vendor allowlist, images. It warns about wording that rots — "new" markers, season-dated releases, marketing metrics, placeholder promises — and about names next to role titles.

Placeholders only: `example-shop.com`, `store-IT`, `<website-uuid>`. No customer names or domains, no staff names, no screenshots, no ticket numbers from internal tools.
