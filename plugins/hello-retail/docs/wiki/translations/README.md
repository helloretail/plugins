# UI Translations (QA team)

Canonical translations for Hello Retail **Search**, **Recommendations**, and **Pages** UI strings, provided by the QA team. Use these **first** whenever you need to translate or change a UI string in a template; only fall back to your own knowledge for strings this file doesn't cover (and make sure the result reads naturally for the locale).

## Files

- **`Translations-2023.xlsx`** — the original source workbook (kept in the internal repository, not bundled here). One tab per language (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Korean, Chinese) plus a `Template` tab. Each tab lays the strings out in three column blocks: **RECOMMENDATIONS** (cols B–D), **SEARCH** (cols F–G), **PAGES** (cols I–J), with the English source string and its translation side by side.
- **`translations.json`** — flattened, lookup-friendly version generated from the workbook. **Use this one when generating templates.**

## `translations.json` shape

```json
{
  "sections": {
    "SEARCH":          { "<English string>": { "da": "…", "sv": "…", "fi": "…", … } },
    "RECOMMENDATIONS": { "<English string>": { … } },
    "PAGES":           { "<English string>": { … } }
  },
  "_meta": { "locales": ["da","de","es","fi","fr","it","ko","nl","no","pl","pt","sv","zh"], … }
}
```

Keyed by the **English** UI string. Locale codes are ISO-style: the workbook's `dk`→`da`, `se`→`sv`, `kr`→`ko`, `cn`→`zh`; all others as-is. A locale key is present only when the workbook had a translation for it (some languages — notably `pt`, `pl` — are partial).

## How to use it (template generation)

1. When the skill resolves the localization header (or changes any UI label), for each English token look it up in `translations.json` under the relevant section (`SEARCH` for Search templates, `RECOMMENDATIONS` for recoms).
2. If the English token matches an entry and the target locale is present → **use that translation verbatim.** Many cells list more than one option separated by `/` (e.g. `"Sortering / Sortera efter"`, or DE `"Ihre Auswahl ergab xx Produkte / Deine Entscheidungen haben gegeben xx Produkte"`) — choose using the rule below.
3. If the token or locale is **missing** → translate from your own knowledge, keep e-commerce register, and add a MISSING-DATA note so the operator can verify.
4. Cross-check against the customer's storefront copy — if their site already uses specific wording, that wins over both this file and the dictionary.

### Choosing between `/`-separated options

Options separated by `/` are **not interchangeable** — they usually differ by **register** (formal vs informal address) and sometimes by **quality** (one is a cleaner phrasing than a literal/awkward one). Decide in this order:

1. **Match the customer's own site.** If the storefront already shows one of the options (or that exact UI label), use it verbatim. Consistency with their site beats everything.
2. **Match the site's register, decided once for the whole template.** Determine formal vs informal from the storefront copy and apply it to *every* option you pick, so the template is internally consistent:
   - German: formal **Sie / Ihr / Ihre** vs informal **Du / Dein / Deine**
   - Dutch: formal **u / uw** vs informal **je / jij / jouw**
   - French: formal **vous** vs informal **tu**
   - Spanish: formal **usted** vs informal **tú**
   - (Nordic languages are effectively always informal — pick the natural one.)
3. **Prefer the natural, concise option.** Discard clumsy literal calques even when they're in the right register (e.g. for DE "Your choices gave xx products", prefer `Ihre Auswahl ergab xx Produkte`, not `Deine Entscheidungen haben gegeben xx Produkte`).
4. **If formal-vs-informal is genuinely ambiguous and it affects the whole UI → ask the operator** instead of guessing; it's a site-wide tone decision.

Default when there is no signal at all: the **first** option, and **formal** register for languages that distinguish (DE/NL/FR/ES) — formal is the safer retail default.

## Regenerating `translations.json`

If the workbook is updated, re-run the extractor (Recommendations = cols 2/3, Search = cols 5/6, Pages = cols 8/9). **Pair each translation with its own English cell *within the same tab*, then merge across tabs on the (normalized) English string** — do **not** align by row number across tabs, because the language tabs have different row counts and that misaligns Finnish/Dutch/Italian/etc.

`translations.json` has also had a manual QA pass on top of the raw extract: embedded notes (`(DON'T USE …)`, `(if … feed)`, English glosses) were stripped from the values, the typo key `Show resultat` was renamed to `Show results`, and a few clear translation errors were corrected (e.g. ES `Sale`/`News`/`New`, FI `Season`, KO highest-price sort, IT `Show product`, NL `Select option`/`Compare`). The workbook remains the untouched master — fold these back into it when convenient.
