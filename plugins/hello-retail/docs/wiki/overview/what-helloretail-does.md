# What Hello Retail Does

## One-liner

> Hello Retail is an AI-powered ecommerce personalization platform that helps merchants deliver relevant search results, recommendations, dynamic pages, retail media, and 1:1 email — all from a single platform with shared Product Intelligence.

## The customer pitch (verbatim from helloretail.com)

> "We help ecommerce teams run better stores. Join the thousands of businesses creating better shopping experiences with our products and proprietary AI."

The platform is positioned as a **360° personalization platform**, organized into two surfaces:

- **Product Discovery & Merchandising** — Search, Product Recommendations, Pages.
- **Customer Activation & Monetization** — Retail Media, Product Agents, Triggered Emails, Newsletter Content, Audience.

Underneath everything sits the **Product Intelligence** foundation — proprietary AI that converts products into vectors and learns cross-shop relationships across millions of products and orders.

## What problems we solve for customers

| Customer pain | Hello Retail module |
| --- | --- |
| Shoppers can't find relevant products via on-site search | Search |
| Low AOV, customers leave without exploring catalog | Product Recommendations |
| Category and brand pages are static, manually curated | Pages |
| Generic newsletters with low CTR | Newsletter Content / Product Agents |
| Abandoned carts and missed re-engagement | Triggered Emails / Product Agents |
| Site traffic isn't being monetized by suppliers | Retail Media (Banners + Sponsored Products) |
| Marketing teams can't segment customers cleanly | Audience |
| No visibility into what's working | Insights + per-feature analytics |

## How customers integrate

Two implementation methods, both supported by D&TS:

1. **Script-based** — drop in the Hello Retail JavaScript, configure feeds and tracking. Quick to implement, managed templates. Best for standard integrations.
2. **API** — full REST / GraphQL access, used for custom solutions or headless setups.

The script loads asynchronously, ships from a CDN, is gzip-compressed, and is browser-cached by URL, so it does not block page rendering. See the KB article [About the Hello Retail JavaScript](https://support.helloretail.com/general-setup/about-the-hello-retail-javascript/) for more.

## Where Hello Retail lives in the customer org

Hello Retail typically lands on the **digital / ecommerce manager's** desk, with hands-on usage from:

- **Merchandisers** — pinning, boosting, fixed products, category logic in Pages.
- **Email marketers** — Newsletter Content blocks, Triggered Email flows, Product Agents.
- **Performance marketers** — Audience export to Facebook, retail media reporting.
- **Developers** — install JS, expose product/order/category feeds, custom API consumers.
