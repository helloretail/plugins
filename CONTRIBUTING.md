# Contributing

## Ground rules

1. **Plugins are self-contained.** Claude Code copies only `plugins/<plugin>/` into its cache.
   Anything a skill reads at runtime (wiki pages, templates, snippets) must live inside the
   plugin directory. Never reference `../`.
2. **No customer-identifiable data in git.** No customer names, domains, website UUIDs, design
   keys, screenshots or QA reports — not in fixtures, not in examples, not in commit messages.
   Use `example.com` / `acme` style placeholders. `QA/` and `output/` are gitignored *and*
   rejected by `npm run validate` if tracked.
3. **No secrets.** MCP configs may reference `${HOME}`-style paths and public URLs only. Auth
   state (`.hr-auth.json`), tokens and `.env` files never enter the repo.
4. **One source of truth.** Edit `plugins/<plugin>/…` directly. There are no generated mirrors
   in this repo. If a job copies content in from elsewhere, its header must say so.
5. **Every shipped change gets a new plugin version — CI does the bump.** After a squash-merge
   the Release workflow raises `plugin.json` → `version` for each plugin the PR touched and tags
   it. The level comes from the PR title (Conventional Commits):
   - `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, … → patch: wording, reference fixes, small template tweaks
   - `feat:` → minor: a new skill, a new reference file, new MCP server
   - `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE` → major: a skill renamed/removed, behaviour users must re-learn
   Bump the version by hand in the PR if you want a specific one; CI keeps it.

## Adding a plugin

```
plugins/<plugin-name>/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json
  README.md
  skills/…
```

`plugin.json` minimum:

```json
{
  "name": "<plugin-name>",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "What it does and who it is for — at least one full sentence.",
  "author": { "name": "Hello Retail D&TS", "email": "pa@helloretail.com" },
  "repository": "https://github.com/helloretail/plugins",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Add it to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` under `plugins` with
`"source": "./plugins/<plugin-name>"`. Run `npm run validate`.

The full layout — every file a plugin carries and why, copy-paste templates for the manifests,
`.mcp.json` and `hooks.json`, the path and naming conventions, and a step-by-step checklist —
is in [PLUGIN-TEMPLATE.md](PLUGIN-TEMPLATE.md). Start a new plugin from it.

## Adding or changing a skill

A skill is a **repeatable, multi-step procedure**. Facts belong in the wiki; one-offs are
not skills.

```
plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md          # required
  references/       # optional deep material, loaded only when the body says so
  scripts/          # optional helpers (bash: must pass shellcheck)
```

`SKILL.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>            # must equal the directory name
description: >
  What it does AND when to fire it. Quote the phrases people actually say ("QA the search
  for [URL]"). This is the trigger the model matches on — a weak description is the #1
  reason a skill never runs. Mention neighbouring skills it should NOT be confused with.
---
```

Organise by **job** (search, recom, feed, QA), never by platform. Platform nuance goes in
`references/<platform>.md` inside the relevant skill.

The full authoring playbook is
[plugins/hello-retail/AUTHORING.md](plugins/hello-retail/AUTHORING.md), which ships inside
the plugin.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main`, one plugin per PR where practical.
- `npm run check` locally before pushing.
- Changed something under `plugins/<plugin>/`? Add a **new file** under that plugin's
  `changelog.d/`, named after your branch — never edit `CHANGELOG.md`, the Release workflow
  writes it. One file per PR means two open PRs never conflict over the release notes. It
  becomes the GitHub Release body, so write it for whoever installs the plugin: the format is
  in `changelog.d/README.md`, the house style in `CLAUDE.md` → "Release notes". Preview the
  next release with `npm run changelog`.
- Fill the PR template; CODEOWNERS get requested automatically.
- CI must be green: validate, markdown lint, shellcheck, secret scan. The version preview is
  informational.
- Squash-merge. The merge commit is what ships: its title is the release-note line **and** decides
  the version bump (`fix:` patch · `feat:` minor · `feat!:` major).

## Testing a change before it ships

Add your checkout as a local marketplace in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/plugins
/plugin install <plugin>@helloretail
```

Edit, then `/reload-plugins`. Remove it afterwards so you go back to the published version.
